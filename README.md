## Task Manager Web Application

**Description:**
- Simple task manager web application where users can register, log in, add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. This project will help you understand concepts like routing, authentication, database operations, and HTML templating in Go.

**Key Features:**
- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Task status (mark tasks as completed)
- User interface to interact with tasks (HTML templates)
- Use of a lightweight database (such as SQLite or BoltDB) to store user information and tasks

## Technologies Used:

**Backend:**
- Go: As the main backend language.
- Gin: A web framework for Go, which provides routing, middleware, and more, making it easier to build web applications.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database.
- Google OAuth: For user authentication using Google accounts.

**Frontend:**
- HTMX: A library that allows you to access AJAX, WebSockets, and server-sent events directly in HTML, making it easier to build modern web applications with minimal JavaScript.

## Steps to Implement:
1. Set up your Go environment.
2. Create a basic web server using Gin.
3. Configure Google OAuth for user authentication.
4. Set up PostgreSQL database and define schemas for users and tasks.
5. Implement CRUD operations for tasks using PostgreSQL.
6. Create HTML pages and use HTMX attributes to enhance interactivity and update content dynamically.
7. Style your application using CSS or any frontend framework of your choice.
8. Test your application thoroughly and fix any bugs.

## Challenges:
- Integrating Google OAuth for user authentication.
- Learning how to work with PostgreSQL for database operations.
- Designing and implementing a user-friendly UI.
- Handling errors and edge cases gracefully.
